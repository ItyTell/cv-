    \section{Language}
        

        \begin{samepage}
            \textbf{English, B2}


            I think I have B2 level, due to a small number of errors on the external examination and on the EVI. 
            I have experience working with foreign colleagues and teachers Most of the content I consumed for 4 years was in English, so language comprehension is at a high level however, there was not much speaking practice.

            Possess B2 English proficiency, as confirmed by external examination and EVI assessment. Regularly collaborated with international colleagues and instructors in English-language in the past. Maintain strong comprehension skills developed through four years of consistent English content consumption across various media. While reading and listening abilities are advanced, focused on expanding conversational fluency through additional speaking practice. (for now it is just speaking with some friend from our minecraft server)

            \textbf{Ukrainian, native}

            \item Python

            Pretty much used this language for all my project during 5 year in university. 
            I have experience with libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, tensorflow, keras, pytorch, etc.
            Some of my projects are on github. (the one thing is most of them are poorly documented)


            \item Math
            

            I graduated with a degree in applied mathematics. 
            I studied various branches of mathematics, including statistics, probability theory, numerical methods and mathematical analysis.


            \item Deep learning
            

            I took a course on Coursera “Deep Learning Specialization” from Deep Learning.AI and received a certificate in 2023.
            Then I played around with the acquired knowledge in Jupyter Notebook, creating and training several neural networks.
            I applied neural networks in my graduate thesis and in personal projects, and also worked with neural networks in the fellow program.

            \item Git, Docker, Linux
            

            I use git for all of my projects and have experience with git and dicker after my fellow program.
            I used to have a Linux computer, now I use Linux mainly with WSL to use GPU in tensorflow (my main computer has Windows).
            
            
            \item Tableau, MS Power BI
            

            Used Power BI in my job to create reports and dashboards for clients.
            I took some courses about data analyst job that included some weeks about data visualization with Power BI and Tableau.
